15 Search Algorithms

This repository contains C++ implementations of 15 classical search algorithms for a sample graph.  
Each algorithm is implemented as a separate standalone `.cpp` file so they can be compiled and run independently.


15 Algorithms include,

1. British Museum Search

2. Breadth‑First Search

3. Depth‑First Search

4. Breadth‑First Search with History

5. Depth‑First Search with History

6. DFS + BFS

7. Hill Climbing Algorithm

8. Beam Search

9. Hill Climbing with History

10. Beam Search with History

11. Oracle Search

12. Branch and Bound

13. Branch and Bound with Estimated Heuristic

14. Branch and Bound with Estimated List

15. A* Search Algorithm
